# Ike: A Chess Engine

---

Ike will be a powerful chess engine written entirely in Rust. It uses advanced techniques like magic bitboards and (when it's finished) alpha-beta pruning. 

When the engine itself is done, I plan to make a GUI for it and host it on a website.

I was of course helped immensely by the Chess Programming Wiki (https://www.chessprogramming.org)

Ike is named after my granfather, who taught me chess when I was a kid. I never did beat him :)
